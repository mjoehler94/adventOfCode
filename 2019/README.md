# Advent of Code 2019

Contains scripts I used to solve the puzzles posted on `adventofcode.com`

### Some things I learned
- I originally implemented the solution to day three using a `for` loop instead of `set` intersection. 
I knew `set` intersection would be faster, but I was surprised that it made an enormous difference in
run time.
